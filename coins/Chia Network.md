# Chia Network

Same as Bitcoin with a few fixes and uses Proof of Space rather than PoW. 

- It is said that no ASIC like hardware for storage will be built since farming (mining) won't produce that much revenue.
- Block times will be the same as bitcoin
- Difficulty logic will be the same as bitcoin
- Supply is increasing at constant rate thus will be inflationary. Number of coins minted in a year will be the same. So no halfing like bitcoin.
- Depends heavily on lightning network for real usecases. 
- Uses Proof of Space and Proof of Time which are two complimentary systems for consensus. 

How is Chia any different from other storage coins such as Burst?
> Burstcoin doesn't have the proof of time component therefore there are attacks that make it unsuitable as a mining algorithm. Additionally, Chia simplifies the math used for proofs of space. Chia also inherits the real world deployment experience of the Bitcoin protocol.

## Questions
- It is mentioned that hard forking will not be the case. I'm not sure if there is finality. Most likely no. Probably they will add governance protocol to the network.
- ASICs might actually make sense.

## Comments
- Chia makes sense mostly if MC => MR is true

# Notes After Talking

## Chia Network Institutional presale Info

www.chia.net

Fast Intro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON5XyZTwugM

## Info:
- Proof of Capacity algorithm is a better one than Proof of Work while keeping all of the PoW economic positives.
- Tech forked from BTC, same liveliness as BTC, better finality (3 block/15 minutes), better decentralization. 
- They claim it can't be hard forked. (Need to verify this)
- Chia will have all improvements made for BTC, including lightning network.
- Will Apache license the code and open source it, before mainnet goes live.
- Writing Chiascript which will replace bitcoin script. It will help softforks. 

## Fundraising:
- Selling equity in the company. Chia company will own the entire premine, then give the premine to shareholders. 
- This system makes it really clear and easy in terms of regulation, nothing can go wrong, everything by the book. 
- Company will never sell tokens.
- Public sale will happen at summer. 
- 1 time dividend will distribute all tokens to company shareholders.
- Genesis block will have 21M. 
- 4M will be kept by company
- 10M will be kept by founders, employees, advisors. These will be vested in 4 years.
- 4M-7M shares will be issued to investors.
- 1 Chia per share will be given out.
- All token amount will be divided by the amount of money raised. So 1M token => $1M or 1M token => $100M. 

## Pre sale:
- Raising $150M, planning to use this money in the next 5 years.
- Minimum $250K for individuals
- Minimum $500K for funds
- 10% cheaper in presale

## Public sale:
- Maximum $250K for all investors

## Payment Method:
- Bitcoin: Uses Gemini daily auction at 4PM NY time. Send money after the auction time. 
- USD

## Team:
- CEO is founder of BitTorrent in 2004. Which is the most used distributed system in the world. They raised $35M. BitTorrent used 30% of the all internet traffic at some point. 
- Other cofounder founded 3 B2B cryptocurrency companies before.  
- 8 engineers. Hiring from 2 backgrounds:
- 1. Experience in BTC protocol: Richard from pycoin, someone from bitcore
- 2. Experience in academics, math, cryptography. 
- Checked their academics and advisors, they are researchers with serious amount of publications in respected journals. 

## Advisors:
- Academics from Stanford, Austria, Chicago
- Elizabeth Stark
- Gene Hoffman (Also an investor)

## Marketing:
- They aren't planning or doing anything for marketing and user adoption at the moment. They probably won't do until 2019.
- Their strategy is getting good institutional investors. In public sale they're targeting as many investors as possible to get wide adoption.
- Compatible with BTC transaction architecture, so institutions adding Chia will be fairly easy. 
- Started conversations with mobile wallets and multi wallet companies. 

## Extra Tech Questions:
- Ask Bram about finality in Keybase. 
- Governance network will have few softworks. People can propose softworks?

## Expecting:
- Contract
- Spreadsheet about cap tables

## Goktug Predictions:
- This is clearly better than PoW in multiple dimensions. Economic incentives show that this is a possible BTC killer. 
- Coinbase might list Chia after its launched. Because they already have 3 legit BTC forks. (Chia is the easiest coin they can list. Much much easier than listing XRP, XLM, ADA, XMR, IOTA because of security and organization issues) 
- This is the most legit coin after Stellar and Cardano. I'm expecting similar returns, unless it gets too oversubscribed early on.
- The only strong risk is miners trying to fuck up Chia and stop them using their connections. (They can't fuck this up by trying to do a network attack, they won't have the harddrive space)
- Which consensus will win isn't clear. You should have your portfolio split up in PoW, PoS, BFT, FBA, PoA, PoC. 
- Since this is the only legit PoC I want to have at least 5%, at most 30% of my portfolio in Chia. 

## Investing in presale scenarios: 
- 1. Market will go bull and increase 10x. We will lose money because we invested in Chia early and not at summer.
- 2. Market will stay the same or go more bearish. We will have saved and made a lot of money by investing in Chia early.
- So investing in Chia is a good hedge. Also the price will go up a lot more in the public sale.
- Investing in Chia presale will give us SWAG points in the upcoming years :)
